Fixed.\n\n# New in 0.2\n\n* helium:insert-import can insert an import at the top of the currently open document.\n* helium:check works on Literate Haskell.\n* heilum:check does a better job of displaying errors that occur in files imported by the checked file.\n* Do a better job of finding ghc-mod and running it from the correct working directory.\n\n# Status\n\nThis project is very roughshod right now.  It is simultaneously a work in progress and a sort of dumping ground for me\nto experiment with Atom's customization APIs.  It is stable enough to be useful for simple tasks, though.\n\n# Installation\n\n```shell\napm install helium\n```\n\nIf you want to get the source directly (eg to hack on it (please, hack on it!)), you can just check it out into your\n`~/.atom/packages` directory.  Then, start atom and run the `update-package-dependencies:update` command to pull in npm\ndependencies.\n",
